  /*
   * !!IMPORTANT NOTE: Changes to this subsystem must be pushed to GitHub through the cage-training branch!!
   *
   * This subsystem will require three files: Cage.java (this one), CageIO.java, and CageIOSpark.java
   * These files must be created using the Java project manager in the bottom left corner. I will show you
   * how to use this feature
   *
   * You will have to create all the methods, class architecture, logic, etc. for this subsystem. After that,
   * we can move on to commands
   *
   * This subsystem represents the mechanism used to dock in the deep cage, which is quite simple.
   * The basic concept is that one motor drives a pair of hooks down onto the base of the cage, pushing the
   * robot up.
   *
   * The subsystem will require only a single motor, which will be a SparkMax.
   * You will need to make a new object in the constants file to represent the motor's CAN ID
   *
   * The subsystem will need to be able to rotate up, rotate down, stop rotating, rotate for a specific
   * amount of time, and rotate to an encoder setpoint.
   * Not all of these tasks will require a separate method, but it is up to you to decide how to approach each
   * task.
   *
   * Remember to use logical variable & method naming, the subsystem structure demonstrated elsewhere in this
   * project, and the concept of superclasses (Hint: this file and the CageIOSpark file will need a superclass)
   *
   * You may refer to other parts of the program if you need to, but try to figure things out on your own first.
   * I am also available as a resource to help you and explain anything you're confused about.
